<p>Hello! My name is Trevor Ablett, and I'm a Staff Research Scientist at Boston Dynamics working on behavior learning for Atlas. I was previously a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the <a href="http://starslab.ca" target="_blank">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab</a> (STARS). I was advised by <a href="http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/" target="_blank">Jonathan Kelly</a>. I investigated methods for improving the sample efficiency of imitation learning and reinforcement learning.</p>

<p> I'm originally from Thornhill, Ontario, in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto" target="_blank">this</a>). I've previously completed a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. </p>

<p> When I'm not working on research, I'm usually exploring with my partner Christina, my son, and my dog Bowie. </p>
