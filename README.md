Code for my personal website. Based on [indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) theme using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

To run locally, use `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## More instructions for local run
On a new machine, if you're missing ruby setup, try [the jekyll instructions here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/).
